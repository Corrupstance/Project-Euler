# Project Euler Solutions In Java

https://projecteuler.net/

Project Euler is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. The project attracts adults and students interested in mathematics and computer programming. Since its creation in 2001 by Colin Hughes, Project Euler has gained notability and popularity worldwide. It includes over 600 problems, with a new one added every weekend (except during the summer). Problems are of varying difficulty but each is solvable in less than a minute using an efficient algorithm on a modestly powered computer. Problems can be sorted on difficulty. (Excerpt from Wikipedia). 

These are my Project Euler Solutions in Java. They should be in working order, but they are no where near optimal. I will endevaour to optimize the solutions when I have the time and try to solve new problems on a bi-weekly basis.
